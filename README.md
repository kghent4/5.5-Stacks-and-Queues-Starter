## Your assignment

Queues:
Simulate a simple call center. Add at least ten calls to your queue (you can store the names of the callers).  Use a loop to work through the queue and have different employees answer the calls until the queue is empty. You should alternate between different employees as evenly as possible.

Stack:
Create a loop to simulate your browser history. The user should be given the option to view their browser history, clear their browser history, look up something else (adds to their browser history), or go back to any previous searches (they give you a number, you take them back that many searches), or quit. It may help to store browser history as a stack of Strings (each String can be a website that was visited).
